### Hi there ðŸ˜„

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Statistics](http://www.mat.uc.cl/departamento-de-estadistica.html) at the Pontificia Universidad CatÃ³lica de Chile. My current research focuses on Bayesian statistics, particularly spatial-temporal and product partition models. Furthermore, I am also interested in statistical modeling/methods in public health and computational methods.
