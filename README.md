### Greetings 🙋🏻🖖

I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Mathematics & Statistics at the [University of Calgary](https://ucalgary.ca/). Specializing in spatial and spatio-temporal modeling within the Bayesian framework, I have concentrated my recent efforts on random partition models. Currently, my research focuses on infectious disease modeling. Additionally, I am also deeply interested in statistical modeling and methods in public health in general, as well as advanced computational methods.
